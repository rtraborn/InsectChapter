\begin{abstract}
Application of Transcription Start Site (TSS) profiling technologies, coupled with large-scale next-generation sequencing (NGS) has yielded valuable insights into the location, structure and activity of promoters across diverse metazoan model systems.
In insects, TSS profiling has been used to characterize the promoter architecture of \textit{D. melanogaster}, and, shortly thereafter, to reveal widespread transposon-driven alternative promoter usage. 

In this chapter we highlight the utility of one TSS profiling method, RAMPAGE (RNA annotation and mapping of promoters for analysis of gene expression), for the precise, quantitative identification of promoters in insect genomes.
We demonstrate this using our bioinformatics pipeline GoRAMPAGE, providing details instructions with the aim of taking the user from raw reads to processed results.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{TSS Profiling}
The promoter, defined in eukaryotes as the genomic region bound by RNA Polymerase II immediately prior to transcription initiation, is the site where regulatory signals unite to direct gene expression.
The identification of promoter regions is a valuable step for understanding the \textit{cis}-regulatory signals that are present in an organism, and is important for genome annotation.
However, despite the rapid accumulation of genome sequences, including those of insects, annotation of promoter regions remains sparse. 
This is because--absent empirical mapping of TSSs--precisely identifying sequence motifs that demarcate the promoter is unreliable.
In contrast with \textit{in silico} approaches, direct mapping of TSSs identifies the location of the core promoter.
Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) \cite{Kodzius:2006gy}, the first method to identify 5`-ends of mRNAs at large-scale, involves selective capture of 5`-capped transcripts, first-strand reverse-transcription and ligation of a short oligonucleotide (CAGE tag). 
CAGE was initially utilized by the FANTOM (Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome) consortium to identify promoter architecture in human and mouse \cite{Carninci:2005kp}, providing the first glimpse of the global landscape of transcription initiation.
At the onset of the NGS era, CAGE was coupled with massively-parallel sequencing to generate 5`-ends of mRNAs at substantially higher scale. This advance provided more extensive coverage of the expressed transcriptome, and provided increased sensitivity for quantitative measurements \textit{i}.\textit{e}. measurement of promoter activity.
Hoskins and colleagues \cite{Hoskins:2011io} performed CAGE in \textit{D. melanogaster}, revealing the promoter architecture in any insect.

\section{Figures}

For \LaTeX\ users, we recommend using the \emph{graphics} or \emph{graphicx}
package and the \verb+\includegraphics+ command.

Please check that the lines in line drawings are not
interrupted and are of a constant width. Grids and details within the
figures must be clearly legible and may not be written one on top of
the other. Line drawings should have a resolution of at least 800 dpi
(preferably 1200 dpi). The lettering in figures should have a height of
2~mm (10-point type). Figures should be numbered and should have a
caption which should always be positioned \emph{under} the figures, in
contrast to the caption belonging to a table, which should always appear
\emph{above} the table; this is simply achieved as matter of sequence in
your source.

Please center the figures or your tabular material by using the \verb+\centering+
declaration. Short captions are centered by default between the margins
and typeset in 9-point type (Fig.~\ref{fig:example} shows an example).
The distance between text and figure is preset to be about 8~mm, the
distance between figure and caption about 6~mm.

To ensure that the reproduction of your illustrations is of a reasonable
quality, we advise against the use of shading. The contrast should be as
pronounced as possible.

If screenshots are necessary, please make sure that you are happy with
the print quality before you send the files.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=6.2cm]{eijkel2}
\caption{One kernel at $x_s$ (\emph{dotted kernel}) or two kernels at
$x_i$ and $x_j$ (\textit{left and right}) lead to the same summed estimate
at $x_s$. This shows a figure consisting of different types of
lines. Elements of the figure described in the caption should be set in
italics, in parentheses, as shown in this sample caption.}
\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

Please define figures (and tables) as floating objects. Please avoid
using optional location parameters like ``\verb+[h]+" for ``here".

\subsection{Formulas}

Displayed equations or formulas are centered and set on a separate
line (with an extra line or halfline space above and below). Displayed
expressions should be numbered for reference. The numbers should be
consecutive within each section or within the contribution,
with numbers enclosed in parentheses and set on the right margin --
which is the default if you use the \emph{equation} environment, e.g.,
\begin{equation}
  \psi (u) = \int_{o}^{T} \left[\frac{1}{2}
  \left(\Lambda_{o}^{-1} u,u\right) + N^{\ast} (-u)\right] dt \;  .
\end{equation}

Equations should be punctuated in the same way as ordinary
text but with a small space before the end punctuation mark.

\subsection{Footnotes}

The superscript numeral used to refer to a footnote appears in the text
either directly after the word to be discussed or -- in relation to a
phrase or a sentence -- following the punctuation sign (comma,
semicolon, or period). Footnotes should appear at the bottom of
the
normal text area, with a line of about 2~cm set
immediately above them.\footnote{The footnote numeral is set flush left
and the text follows with the usual word spacing.}

\subsection{Program Code}

Program listings or program commands in the text are normally set in
typewriter font, e.g., CMTT10 or Courier.

\begin{verbatim}
program Inflation (Output)
  {Assuming annual inflation rates of 7%, 8%, and 10%,...

   var

     Factor1, Factor2, Factor3: Real;

     Year := 0;
     Factor1 := 1.0; Factor2 := 1.0; Factor3 := 1.0;
     WriteLn('Year  7% 8% 10%'); WriteLn;
     repeat
       Year := Year + 1;
       Factor1 := Factor1 * 1.07;
       Factor2 := Factor2 * 1.08;
       Factor3 := Factor3 * 1.10;
       WriteLn(Year:5,Factor1:7:3,Factor2:7:3,Factor3:7:3)
     until Year = MaxYears
end.

\subsection{Citations}

For citations in the text please use
square brackets and consecutive numbers: \cite{jour}, \cite{lncschap},
\cite{proceeding1} -- provided automatically
by \LaTeX 's \verb|\cite| \dots\verb|\bibitem| mechanism.

\subsection{Page Numbering and Running Heads}

There is no need to include page numbers. If your paper title is too
long to serve as a running head, it will be shortened. Your suggestion
as to how to shorten it would be most welcome.

\section{References}\label{references}

\newpage

% if your bibliography is in bibtex format, use those commands:
\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran} % Bibliography style file
\bibliography{RAMPAGE_chapter}      % Bibliography file

In order to permit cross referencing within LNCS-Online, and eventually
between different publishers and their online databases, LNCS will,
from now on, be standardizing the format of the references. This new
feature will increase the visibility of publications and facilitate
academic research considerably. Please base your references on the
examples below. References that don't adhere to this style will be
reformatted by Springer. You should therefore check your references
thoroughly when you receive the final pdf of your paper.
The reference section must be complete. You may not omit references.
Instructions as to where to find a fuller version of the references are
not permissible.

We only accept references written using the latin alphabet. If the title
of the book you are referring to is in Russian or Chinese, then please write

of the title.

The following section shows a sample reference list with entries for
journal articles \cite{jour}, an LNCS chapter \cite{lncschap}, a book
\cite{book}, proceedings without editors \cite{proceeding1} and
